## Planned Integration Review

1. Validate each source for licensing, maintenance activity, and production viability.
2. Extract reusable signal-generation and dataset interfaces.
3. Map integrations to QuantFusion modules:
   - strategy research
   - feature engineering
   - data ingestion / MCP adapter
4. Add implementation tasks only after reproducible backtest evidence.
