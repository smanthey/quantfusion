# Algorithmic Crypto Trading Platform

## Project Overview
A production-ready algorithmic crypto trading platform with multi-strategy execution, regime detection, dynamic allocation, and comprehensive risk management.

## Key Features
- Multi-strategy ensemble (mean reversion, trend following, breakout)
- Regime detection and dynamic strategy allocation
- Walk-forward backtesting with Monte Carlo validation
- Real-time execution with slippage and fee modeling
- Comprehensive risk management with circuit breakers
- Explore/exploit learning system
- Responsive web dashboard

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS, responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with real-time WebSocket data
- **Database**: In-memory storage initially, PostgreSQL ready
