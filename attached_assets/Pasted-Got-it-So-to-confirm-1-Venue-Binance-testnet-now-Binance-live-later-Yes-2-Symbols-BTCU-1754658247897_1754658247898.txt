Got it ✅
So to confirm:
	1.	Venue – Binance testnet now, Binance live later → Yes
	2.	Symbols – BTCUSDT + ETHUSDT → Yes
	3.	Risk defaults – per-trade 0.5%, daily loss cap 2%, max DD 10%, explore 10% → Yes

⸻

Here’s exactly what you’ll get in the first bundle I send:

⸻

A) Strategy Engine (multi-strat, adaptive)
	•	Three families:
	•	Mean-Reversion (z/Bollinger)
	•	Breakout (ATR/range)
	•	Trend-MA (MA/Donchian)
	•	Run in parallel with MetaAllocator (risk-capped, correlation-aware)
	•	Regime gates: trend/chop/off from vol + spread
	•	Explore/Exploit loop: 10% of risk for new params, promotes winners
	•	Promotion/Demotion: ≥300 OOS trades or 30d, PF≥1.2, DD≤cap
	•	Walk-forward CV, Bayesian tuning, Monte-Carlo, Reality Check

⸻

B) Execution & Risk
	•	Binance testnet/live connector, idempotent orders, async retry/backoff
	•	Fee/Slippage model calibrated from fills (feedback loop)
	•	Position sizing: per-trade %, ATR/time stops, capped-Kelly
	•	Kill switches: day DD, slippage spike, fill drop, latency spike → flatten & pause
	•	Circuit breakers (day/week), cool-downs, symbol halts
	•	UTC everywhere, NTP drift check

⸻

C) Data & Metrics
	•	SQLite schema: candles, signals, trades, runs, configs, fills
	•	Audit log for every decision (signal, filters, size, stop)
	•	Prometheus-friendly metrics: PnL, DD, turnover, slippage, maker/taker %, fill %, latency
	•	Drift monitor: live PF vs walk-forward PF ± bands; auto de-weight on drift
	•	Golden backtest snapshot for CI regression tests

⸻

D) Dev Experience
	•	/ai brain in repo: prompts, decisions, TODOs
	•	CLI commands:
	•	backtest – run walk-forward CV + optimize
	•	paper – connect to Binance testnet
	•	live – connect to Binance live
	•	CI checks for reproducibility + metric drift alerts

⸻

E) Extensibility
	•	FX integration (OANDA) ready to add after crypto is stable
	•	Modular strategy loader → drop in new strats without touching core
	•	Allocator supports cross-market portfolios (crypto + FX)

⸻

If you want, I can deliver the repo with:
	•	Install script for dependencies
	•	One-command start for each mode (python app.py backtest, python app.py paper, python app.py live)
	•	Example config for Binance keys, symbols, risk, explore budget
	•	Dashboard (Streamlit) showing: allocations, regime, live stats, explore trials

⸻

Do you want me to build this first version with just BTCUSDT & ETHUSDT live-ready, and then once stable we’ll bolt on the Forex module? That way the same allocator/regime logic can run BTC/ETH + EURUSD/GBPUSD later with no rework.
